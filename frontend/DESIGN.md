# design 

Rules: do not overpopulate the globals.css file. Do NOT add unnecsseary styling, do NOT worry about light mode for the first iteration. Assume that dark mode is the only mode.

## styling 

Use a monochrome black and white styling with a NeoBrutalistic inspired design. Dark mode colors: Black for the background, white text, sharp corners.

## Microinteractions 

1. hover: when the user hovers over a button, in dark mode, change the background color of the element from black to white and change the text color to black.
2. expand: when the user hovers over an element, expand the size of the element.
